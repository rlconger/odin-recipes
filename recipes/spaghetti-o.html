        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ring-shaped pasta</li>
            <li>1.875 pounds tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Cantanzaro herbs, (such as Savory Spice Shop Cantanzaro herbs)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound Italian-style meatballs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly shaved Parmesan cheese, or as needed, for garnish</li>
            <li>fresh basil, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><h3>Step 1</h3></p>
        <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet furm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, drain pasta, and set aside.</p>
        <p><h3>Step 2</h3></p>
        <p>Add tomato sause, Cantanzaro herbs, sugar, salt, and pepper to the pot; bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.</p>
        <p><h3>Step 3</h3></p>
        <p>Meanwhile, cut each meatball into 4 pieces. roll each piece into a mini meatball. Drop meatballs into sauce; simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes. If sauce seems to thick, thin out by adding pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time.</p>
        <p><h3>Step 4</h3></p>
        <p>Stir in cooked pasta rings. Garnish with basil leaves and Parmesan shavings and serve immediately.</p>
